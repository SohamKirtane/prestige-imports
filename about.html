                    Prestige Imports is not your typical dealership.
                    We are not just about selling cars, we are selling lifestyles - the high-end lifestyle that matches the level of our incredible cars and the luxurious Miami lifestyle that makes our city a premier global destination.
                    We’re a second-generation family-owned dealership that’s delivered an exceptional level of customer service for luxury car shoppers from North Miami Beach, South Florida and around the world since 1977.
                    Prestige Imports successes have been covered by the media as well, including a recent article in Automotive News.
                    Also, Haute Living covered our work with Ride2Revive, where we share our love of luxury cars with sick children in North Miami Beach.
                    <br><br>
                    We are one of North America’s leading Lamborghini dealerships, with such phenomenal models as the Aventador, Huracan and Urus.
                    Our website doesn't even come close to displaying all the new Lamborghini vehicles that we have in stock.
                    Because of the exclusive nature of these unique vehicles, Lamborghini only allows us to display a few online, but if you come down to see us, you can witness all the unique Lamborghini vehicles that we have in our showroom.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to the Lamborghini models, our Pagani selection includes the Huayra and Zonda, while Lotus models include the Evora and Elise. 
                    We even offer VanDutch boats if you’re looking for luxury on the water.
                    With 15 million dollars of vehicles at Prestige Imports, we are an internationally-renowned destination for luxury cars.
                    Also, we recognize that our customers have unique tastes, and with this in mind, we can bespoke any exotic vehicle to your desired specifications. 
                    We do the full range of the personalization spectrum — from mild to wild.

                    We also offer a massive selection of luxury pre-owned vehicles, including Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bentley, Mercedes, Porsche, Lotus, Pagani, Bentley and Rolls-Royce, as well as a very large inventory of pre-owned Bugatti models.

                    If you have an older vehicle, trading it in is a great way to reduce the overall cost of your next vehicle purchase.
                    A vehicle trade-in is made easy at Prestige Imports.
                    We can help you avoid the hassle and save money with our trade-in process.
                    You can get started here on the Prestige Imports website and talk to a member of our team to work out the details.
